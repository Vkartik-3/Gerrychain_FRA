Gerrymandering Detection Example
===============================

This script demonstrates how GerryChain can detect gerrymandering by:
1. Creating a fair initial map
2. Intentionally gerrymandering it
3. Using MCMC to show the gerrymandered map is an outlier

Think of this as creating evidence for a court case!
