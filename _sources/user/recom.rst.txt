==========================
Running a chain with ReCom
==========================

Our goal now is to get a handle on using GerryChain to run Markov chains with
both regular and region-aware settings. Throughout this guide, we'll use the
toy state of GerryMandria, which has needs to be divided into 8 districts.

The legislature of the state of GerryMandria has provided us with the
following districting plan:

.. image:: ./images/gerrymandria.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center

which has corresponding dual graph given by:

.. image:: ./images/gerrymandria_district.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center

``gerrychain`` works primarily with the dual graph of the districting plan, so
all of the pictures in this guide will use the dual graph as well.

A Simple Recom Chain
====================

        Download GerryMandria File
      </a>
    </div>
    <br style="line-height: 5px;">

Let us start by running a simple ReCom chain on this districting plan. Of course,
the first thing to do is to import the required packages:

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from gerrychain import (Partition, Graph, MarkovChain,
                            updaters, constraints, accept)
    from gerrychain.proposals import recom
    from gerrychain.constraints import contiguous
    from functools import partial
    import pandas

    # Set the random seed so that the results are reproducible!
    import random
    random.seed(42)

Now we set up the initial partition:

.. code-block:: python 

    graph = Graph.from_json("./gerrymandria.json")

    my_updaters = {
        "population": updaters.Tally("TOTPOP"),
        "cut_edges": updaters.cut_edges
    }

    initial_partition = Partition(
        graph,
        assignment="district",
        updaters=my_updaters
    )

And we make the proposal:

.. code-block:: python

    # This should be 8 since each district has 1 person in it.
    # Note that the key "population" corresponds to the population updater
    # that we defined above and not with the population column in the json file.
    ideal_population = sum(initial_partition["population"].values()) / len(initial_partition)

    proposal = partial(
        recom,
        pop_col="TOTPOP",
        pop_target=ideal_population,
        epsilon=0.01,
        node_repeats=2
    )

We can now set up the chain:

.. code-block:: python

    recom_chain = MarkovChain(
        proposal=proposal,
        constraints=[contiguous],
        accept=accept.always_accept,
        initial_state=initial_partition,
        total_steps=20
    )

and run it with

.. code-block:: python

  assignment_list = []

  for i, item in enumerate(recom_chain):
      print(f"Finished step {i+1}/{len(recom_chain)}", end="\r")
      assignment_list.append(item.assignment)


We'll go ahead an collect the assignment at each step of the chain so
that we can watch the chain work in a fun animation (of course, it would be a
bad idea to do this for a chain with a large number of steps).

.. code-block:: python

    %matplotlib inline
    import matplotlib_inline.backend_inline
    import matplotlib.cm as mcm
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import networkx as nx
    from PIL import Image
    import io
    import ipywidgets as widgets
    from IPython.display import display, clear_output

    frames = []

    for i in range(len(assignment_list)):
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))
        pos = {node :(data['x'],data['y']) for node, data in graph.nodes(data=True)}
        node_colors = [mcm.tab20(int(assignment_list[i][node]) % 20) for node in graph.nodes()]
        node_labels = {node: str(assignment_list[i][node]) for node in graph.nodes()}
        
        nx.draw_networkx_nodes(graph, pos, node_color=node_colors)
        nx.draw_networkx_edges(graph, pos)
        nx.draw_networkx_labels(graph, pos, labels=node_labels)
        plt.axis('off')
        
        buffer = io.BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(buffer, format='png')
        buffer.seek(0)
        image = Image.open(buffer)
        frames.append(image)
        plt.close(fig)

    def show_frame(idx):
        clear_output(wait=True)
        display(frames[idx])

    slider = widgets.IntSlider(value=0, min=0, max=len(frames)-1, step=1, description='Frame:')
    slider.layout.width = '500px'
    widgets.interactive(show_frame, idx=slider)

And this should generate a little widget that you can move through to see the chain
in action! Here is a gif of what it should look like:

.. image:: ./images/gerrymandria_ensamble.gif
    :width: 400px
    :align: center

Region-Aware ReCom
==================

Of course, in the state of GerryMandria, the legislature has decided that it would like
to try to keep the municipality of Gerryville together in a single district. In fact, it would
really prefer to keep all of the municipalities together if possible, and, as such any analysis
that you do needs to be on a ensemble of districting plans that try to keep municipalities 
together. Here is a picture of the municipalities in GerryMandria:

.. image:: ./images/gerrymandria_cities.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center

Fortunately, ``gerrychain`` has a built-in functionality that allows for
region-aware ReCom chains which create ensembles
of districting plans that try to keep particular regions of interest together.
And it only takes one extra line of code: we simply update
our proposal to include a ``weight_dict`` which increases the importance of the
edges within the municipalities.

.. code-block:: python

    proposal = partial(
        recom,
        pop_col="TOTPOP",
        pop_target=ideal_population,
        epsilon=0.01,
        node_repeats=2,
        weight_dict={"muni": 0.8},
    )

And this will produce the following ensemble:

.. image:: ./images/gerrymandria_region_ensamble.gif
    :width: 400px
    :align: center

Now, the legislature of GerryMandria has decided that it would also like to try
to keep the counties together as well. They mention to you that it would be nice
to keep the municipalities together, but that it is more important to keep the
water districts together. Here is a picture of the water districts in GerryMandria:

.. image:: ./images/gerrymandria_water.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center

Notice that there is a river that seems to cut through the middle of the state,
and so it is not going to be possible to keep all of the water districts together
and all of the municipalities together in one plan. However, we can try to keep
the water districts together as much as possible, and then, within those water
districts, try to be sensitive to the boundaries of the municipalities. Again, 
this only requires for us to edit the ``weight_dict`` parameter of the proposal

.. code-block:: python

    proposal = partial(
        recom,
        pop_col="TOTPOP",
        pop_target=ideal_population,
        epsilon=0.01,
        node_repeats=2,
        weight_dict={"muni": 0.2, "water": 0.8},
    )

Since we are trying to be sensitive to multiple bits of information, we should probably
also increase the length of our chain to make sure that we have time to mix properly.

.. code-block:: python

    recom_chain = MarkovChain(
        proposal=proposal,
        constraints=[contiguous],
        accept=accept.always_accept,
        initial_state=initial_partition,
        total_steps=10000
    )

Then, we can run the chain and look at the last 20 assignments in the ensemble

.. image:: ./images/gerrymandria_water_muni_ensamble.gif
    :width: 400px
    :align: center

Comparing the last map with the municipality and water district maps, we can see
that the chain has done a pretty good job of keeping the water districts together
while also being sensitive to the municipalities

.. figure:: ./images/gerrymandria_water_and_muni_aware.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center

    The last map in the ensemble from the 10000 step region-aware ReCom chain with
    weights of 0.2 for the municipalities and 0.8 for the water districts.

.. _weight-dict-warning:

.. attention::

  The ``weight_dict`` parameter is a dictionary that assigns a weight to each
  edge within a particular region that is determined by the keys of the dictionary.
  In the event that multiple regions are specified, the weights are added together,
  and if the weights add to more than 1, then the following warning will be printed 
  to the user:

  .. code-block:: console
    
    ValueWarning: 
    The sum of the weights in the weight dictionary is greater than 1.
    Please consider normalizing the weights.

  It is generally inadvisable to set the weight of a region to 1 or more. When
  using :meth:`~gerrychain.proposals.recom` with a ``weight_dict``, the proposal
  will try to draw a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm where,
  the weights are in the range :math:`[0,1]`, then the weights from the weight
  dictionary are added to them. In the event that
  many edges within the tree have a weight above 1, then it can sometimes
  cause the biparitioning step to stall.


What to do if the Chain Gets Stuck
==================================

Sometimes, either because of the constraints that you have imposed or because of
the shape of the graph that you are working with, a recom chain can get stuck and
will throw an error. For example, if we try to be a bit too demanding of the 
region-aware chain given above
and ask for a plan that effectively never splits a municipality nor a water
district, then the chain will get stuck and throw an error. Here is the setup:

.. code-block:: python

    from gerrychain import (Partition, Graph, MarkovChain,
                            updaters, constraints, accept)
    from gerrychain.proposals import recom
    from gerrychain.tree import bipartition_tree
    from gerrychain.constraints import contiguous
    from functools import partial
    import random
    random.seed(42)

    graph = Graph.from_json("./gerrymandria.json")

    my_updaters = {
        "population": updaters.Tally("TOTPOP"),
        "cut_edges": updaters.cut_edges
    }

    initial_partition = Partition(
        graph,
        assignment="district",
        updaters=my_updaters
    )

    ideal_population = sum(initial_partition["population"].values()) / len(initial_partition)

    proposal = partial(
        recom,
        pop_col="TOTPOP",
        pop_target=ideal_population,
        epsilon=0.01,
        node_repeats=1,
        weight_dict={"muni": 1.0, "water_dist": 1.0},
    )

    recom_chain = MarkovChain(
        proposal=proposal,
        constraints=[contiguous],
        accept=accept.always_accept,
        initial_state=initial_partition,
        total_steps=20
    )

    assignment_list = []

    for i, item in enumerate(recom_chain):
        print(f"Finished step {i + 1}/{len(recom_chain)}", end="\r")
        assignment_list.append(item.assignment)

This will output the following sequence of warnings and errors

.. code-block:: console

    ValueWarning: 
    The sum of the weights in the weight dictionary is greater than 1.
    Please consider normalizing the weights.

    BipartitionWarning: 
    Failed to find a balanced cut after 50 attempts.
    If possible, consider enabling pair reselection within your
    MarkovChain proposal method to allow the algorithm to select
    a different pair of nodes to try an recombine.

    RuntimeError: Could not find a possible cut after 100000 attempts.

Note: if this error does not appear at step 8, then you probalby forgot
to rerun the part of the script that sets the random seed to 42.
Let's break down what is happening in each of these:

.. raw:: html

  <ul>
    <li><strong>ValueWarning</strong> 
      This is just telling us that we have made an ill-advised
      choice of weights for our regions. See <a href="#weight-dict-warning">the above warning</a> 
      for more information.
    </li>
    <br style="line-height: 5px;">
    <li><strong>BipartitionWarning</strong>
      This is telling us that somewhere along the way, 
      we picked a pair of districts that were difficult to bipartition underneath
      the constraints that we have imposed. More accurately, for the pair of districts
      that we have selected to recombine, we have selected a root node for a spanning
      tree, and we are trying to find a cut at some point along that tree that satisfies
      all of the conditions. We have tried to draw a tree 50 times and have failed to
      find a balanced cut of any of the trees starting from the selected root node.
      This indicates that either we have selected a difficult node to start from,
      or that the pair of districts we are considering is difficult
      to split regardless of the choice of root node. 
      If the problem is the choice of root node, we can fix it by increasing the 
      <code style="color: #E74C3C;">node_repeats</code> parameter of the 
      <code style="color: #E74C3C;">MarkovChain</code>. However, if the problem is
      that the pair of districts themselves are difficult to split, then this can
      generally only be fixed by allowing the chain to reselect the pair of districts
      that it is trying to split.
    </li>
    <br style="line-height: 5px;">
    <li><strong>RuntimeError</strong>
        This is telling us that we have tried to draw a tree 10000 times for each
        node that we have selected, and that we failed to find a valid cut in all
        of them. This is a pretty strong indication that the pair of districts that 
        we are trying to split is just too difficult to split and that we need to
        enable reselection.
    </li>
  </ul>

Okay, let's see if we can fix this. First, we'll try to increase the number of
node repeats:

.. code-block:: python

    proposal = partial(
        recom,
        pop_col="TOTPOP",
        pop_target=ideal_population,
        epsilon=0.01,
        node_repeats=100,
        weight_dict={"muni": 1.0, "water_dist": 1.0},
    )

Running this code, we can see that we get stuck once again, so this was not the fix.
Let's try to enable reselection instead:

.. code-block:: python 

    method = partial(bipartition_tree, allow_pair_reselection=True)

    proposal = partial(
        recom,
        pop_col="TOTPOP",
        pop_target=ideal_population,
        epsilon=0.01,
        node_repeats=1,
        weight_dict={"muni": 1.0, "water_dist": 1.0},
        method=method
    )

And this time it works! 


A Real-World Example
====================

In this example, we'll use GerryChain to analyze the 2011 districting plan for
Pennsylvania's state legislative districts. We'll compare the partisan vote
shares in the 2011 plan to those in an ensemble of districting plans generated
by our ReCom chain.



Imports
-------

As always, the first step is to import everything we need

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from gerrychain import (GeographicPartition, Partition, Graph, MarkovChain,
                            proposals, updaters, constraints, accept, Election)
    from gerrychain.proposals import recom
    from functools import partial
    import pandas


Setting up the initial districting plan
---------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <div class="center-container">
      <a href="https://github.com/mggg/GerryChain/blob/main/docs/_static/PA_VTDs.json" class="download-badge" download>Download PA File</a>
    </div>
    <br style="line-height: 5px;">

We'll create our graph using the example Pennsylvania json file.

.. code-block:: python

    graph = Graph.from_json("./PA_VTDs.json")

We may now configure :class:`~gerrychain.Election` objects representing some of 
the election data from our file.

.. code-block:: python

    elections = [
        Election("SEN10", {"Democratic": "SEN10D", "Republican": "SEN10R"}),
        Election("SEN12", {"Democratic": "USS12D", "Republican": "USS12R"}),
        Election("SEN16", {"Democratic": "T16SEND", "Republican": "T16SENR"}),
        Election("PRES12", {"Democratic": "PRES12D", "Republican": "PRES12R"}),
        Election("PRES16", {"Democratic": "T16PRESD", "Republican": "T16PRESR"})
    ]
    

Configuring our updaters
++++++++++++++++++++++++

We want to set up updaters for everything we want to compute for each plan in the ensemble. 
In this case, we want to keep track of the population of each district and election info
for each of our previously defined elections.

.. code-block:: python
    
    # Population updater, for computing how close to equality the district
    # populations are. "TOTPOP" is the population column from our shapefile.
    my_updaters = {"population": updaters.Tally("TOT_POP", alias="population")}
    
    # Election updaters, for computing election results using the vote totals
    # from our shapefile.
    election_updaters = {election.name: election for election in elections}
    my_updaters.update(election_updaters)


Instantiating the partition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We can now instantiate the initial state of our Markov chain, using the 2011 districting plan

.. code-block:: python

    initial_partition = GeographicPartition(
        graph, 
        assignment="2011_PLA_1", 
        updaters=my_updaters
    )
    
The class :class:`~gerrychain.GeographicPartition` comes with built-in ``area`` and 
``perimeter`` updaters. We do not use them here since (i) the \*.json file that we 
are working with does not have geometric information and (ii) geometric updaters tend
to slow the chain quite considerably (and this is just an example), but they would 
allow us to compute compactness scores like Polsby-Popper that depend on these 
measurements.

Setting up the Markov chain
---------------------------

Proposal
++++++++

First we'll set up the ReCom proposal. To do this we will need to make use of the python
`functools`_ package, specifically the ``partial`` function within this package. 

.. admonition:: Use of ``functools.partial``
  :class: note


  For the 
  uninitiated, the ``functools.partial`` function allows us to create a new function from
  an existing function by binding the values of some of the arguments. For example,
  we might have a function to make a colored square:

  .. code-block:: python

    from PIL import Image

    def make_color_square(red_val, green_val, blue_val):
        img = Image.new('RGB', (100, 100), color = (red_val, green_val, blue_val))
        return img


  And we can then use this to make a new function that always makes a blue square:

  .. code-block:: python

    make_blue_square = partial(make_color_square, red_val=0, green_val=0)

    make_color_square(red_val=255, green_val=0, blue_val=0).show() # Makes a red square
    make_blue_square(blue_val=255).show() # Makes a blue square


Back to Recom, we need to fix some parameters using `functools.partial`
before we can use it as our proposal function.

.. code-block:: python

    # The ReCom proposal needs to know the ideal population for the districts so that
    # we can improve speed by bailing early on unbalanced partitions.
    
    ideal_population = sum(initial_partition["population"].values()) / len(initial_partition)
    
    # We use functools.partial to bind the extra parameters (pop_col, pop_target, epsilon, node_repeats)
    # of the recom proposal.
    proposal = partial(
        recom,
        pop_col="TOT_POP",
        pop_target=ideal_population,
        epsilon=0.02,
        node_repeats=2
    )


Constraints
+++++++++++

To keep districts about as compact as the original plan, we would like to
constrain the number of cut edges between all of the districts (this will
keep our districts from being too snake-like).
We can do this using the :class:`~gerrychain.constraints.UpperBound` constraint,
and, as a general heuristic, we'll bound the number of cut edges by twice the
number of cut edges in the initial plan.

.. code-block:: python
    
    def cut_edges_length(p):
      return len(p["cut_edges"])

    compactness_bound = constraints.UpperBound(
      cut_edges_length,
      2*len(initial_partition["cut_edges"])
    )

    pop_constraint = constraints.within_percent_of_ideal_population(initial_partition, 0.02)


.. admonition:: Coding Note
  :class: note

  We can simplify the calling of this compactness bound using lambda functions.

  .. code-block:: python

    compactness_bound = constraints.UpperBound(
      lambda p: len(p["cut_edges"]),
      2*len(initial_partition["cut_edges"])
    )

  The use of lambda functions tends to be a more advanced coding technique, but
  the benefit is that we do not need to define a new function for each constraint
  that we want to use, and they can make the code more readable.

Configuring the Markov chain
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: python

    chain = MarkovChain(
        proposal=proposal,
        constraints=[
            pop_constraint,
            compactness_bound
        ],
        accept=accept.always_accept,
        initial_state=initial_partition,
        total_steps=1000
    )

Running the chain
-----------------

Now we'll run the chain, putting the sorted Democratic vote percentages directly
into a :mod:`pandas` :class:`~pandas.DataFrame` for analysis and plotting. The ``DataFrame``
will have a row for each state of the chain. The first column of the ``DataFrame`` will
hold the lowest Democratic vote share among the districts in each partition in the chain, the
second column will hold the second-lowest Democratic vote shares, and so on.

.. code-block:: python

    # This might take a few minutes.
    
    data = pandas.DataFrame(
        sorted(partition["SEN12"].percents("Democratic"))
        for partition in chain
    )

If you are wondering what the ``for`` loop inside of the parentheses
is doing, please see the `this note <./quickstart.html#list-comprehension>`_.
If you install the ``tqdm`` package, you can see a progress bar
as the chain runs by running this code instead

.. code-block:: python
    
    data = pandas.DataFrame(
        sorted(partition["SEN12"].percents("Democratic"))
        for partition in chain.with_progress_bar()
    )

Create a plot
-------------

Now we'll create a box plot to help visualize the data report.

.. code-block:: python

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

    # Draw 50% line
    ax.axhline(0.5, color="#cccccc")

    # Draw boxplot
    data.boxplot(ax=ax, positions=range(len(data.columns)))

    # Draw initial plan's Democratic vote %s (.iloc[0] gives the first row)
    plt.plot(data.iloc[0], "ro")

    # Annotate
    ax.set_title("Comparing the 2011 plan to an ensemble")
    ax.set_ylabel("Democratic vote % (Senate 2012)")
    ax.set_xlabel("Sorted districts")
    ax.set_ylim(0, 1)
    ax.set_yticks([0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1])

There you go! To build on this, here are some possible next steps:

* Add, remove, or tweak the constraints
* Perform a similar analysis on a different districting plan for Pennsylvania
* Perform a similar analysis on a different state
* Compute partisan symmetry scores like Efficiency Gap or Mean-Median, and
  create a histogram of the scores of the ensemble.
* Perform the same analysis using a different election than the 2012 Senate election
* Collect Democratic vote percentages for *all* the elections we set up, instead
  of just the 2012 Senate election.
