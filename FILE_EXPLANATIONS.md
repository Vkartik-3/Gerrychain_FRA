üöÄ GerryChain Gerrymandering Detection Simulation
============================================================
üèôÔ∏è  Creating 8x8 city grid...
‚úÖ Created city with 64 blocks and 638 people
üó∫Ô∏è  Dividing city into 4 districts...
‚úÖ Initial districts created:
   District 0: 149 people, 73 vs 76 votes ‚Üí Party B wins
   District 1: 160 people, 87 vs 73 votes ‚Üí Party A wins
   ...

üé≤ Running MCMC simulation for 1000 steps...
   Step 200: Generated 200 alternative maps
   ...

üìä Analyzing Results...
Original map: Party A wins 3 out of 4 districts

In 1000 alternative fair maps:
   Average Party A districts: 3.51
   Party A wins 3 districts: 471 times (47.1%)

üîç Gerrymandering Analysis:
‚úÖ Original result occurs in 47.1% of fair maps
   This appears normal
```

**What the results mean:**
- **47.1%** = Original map appears in 47.1% of fair alternatives
- **Verdict:** ‚úÖ FAIR (above 10% threshold)
- No evidence of gerrymandering detected

**When to use it:**
- Learning GerryChain for the first time
- Testing that MCMC algorithm works
- Quick demonstrations (30 seconds)
- Understanding ensemble comparison concept

---

### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding

#### 3. `detect_gerrymandering.py` - Comparing Fair vs Biased Maps

**What it does:**
1. Creates a **8√ó8 city** with geographic voting patterns (urban core vs suburbs)
2. Creates TWO different district maps using different random seeds:
   - **Seed 42:** "Fair" map
   - **Seed 999:** Potentially "Biased" map
3. Runs MCMC on BOTH maps to see which is more typical
4. Compares p-values to determine which is suspicious

**Why you need it:**
- Shows that **the same city can have different district outcomes**
- Demonstrates how random seed affects fairness
- Teaches the concept of "outlier detection"
- More realistic than `simple_simulation.py` (uses geographic clustering)

**Key innovation:**
Uses **distance-from-center** to create realistic voting patterns:
```python
if distance_from_center < 2:
    dem_pct = 0.70  # Urban core: 70% Democratic
elif distance_from_center < 3:
    dem_pct = 0.45  # Inner suburbs: 45% Democratic
else:
    dem_pct = 0.30  # Outer suburbs: 30% Democratic
```

**How to run:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python detect_gerrymandering.py
```

**What to expect:**
- Creates city with realistic geographic voting
- Tests fair map (seed 42)
- Tests biased map (seed 999)
- Compares p-values between the two

**When to use it:**
- After understanding `simple_simulation.py`
- Learning about geographic clustering
- Understanding how seed selection matters
- Comparing multiple maps from same city

---

#### 4. `working_gerrymander_demo.py` - Realistic Pack-and-Crack

**What it does:**
1. Creates a **6√ó6 city** where Democrats have ~52% citywide support
2. Creates a "fair" map using geographic division
3. Creates a "gerrymandered" map using manual assignment
4. Runs MCMC on both to detect which is an outlier

**Why you need it:**
- Demonstrates the **pack-and-crack strategy** explicitly
- Uses more realistic city size (6√ó6 = 36 blocks)
- Shows intentional gerrymandering technique
- Educational tool for understanding manipulation methods

**Pack-and-Crack Strategy Explained:**
```
Fair Map:
District 1: 52% Dem ‚Üí Dem wins
District 2: 51% Dem ‚Üí Dem wins
District 3: 53% Dem ‚Üí Dem wins
Result: Democrats win 3/3 (matches 52% support)

Gerrymandered Map:
District 1: 85% Dem ‚Üí Dem wins (PACKED - wasted votes)
District 2: 48% Dem ‚Üí Rep wins (CRACKED - split Dems)
District 3: 47% Dem ‚Üí Rep wins (CRACKED - split Dems)
Result: Democrats win 1/3 (despite 52% support!)
```

**How to run:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python working_gerrymander_demo.py
```

**When to use it:**
- Understanding gerrymandering tactics
- Educational presentations
- Seeing pack-and-crack in action
- More realistic than simple_simulation

---

#### 5. `gerrymandering_detection.py` - Polarized City Analysis

**What it does:**
1. Creates a **10√ó10 polarized city** (100 blocks)
2. Models Democrats clustering in urban core, Republicans in suburbs
3. Uses population density (denser in center)
4. Creates fair districts using `recursive_tree_part`
5. Runs extensive MCMC to find expected outcomes

**Why you need it:**
- **Larger scale** (100 blocks vs 36-64)
- **Realistic urban geography** (population density varies)
- Shows how real cities have clustered voters
- Longer runtime for more statistical confidence

**Unique features:**
- **Population density varies:** Urban core has 15-20 people/block, rural areas 5-10
- **Voter clustering:** 80% Dem in center, 20% Dem in outer areas
- Uses **5 districts** instead of 4
- Allows 15% population deviation (realistic constraint)

**How to run:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python gerrymandering_detection.py
```

**When to use it:**
- Analyzing larger cities
- Understanding urban vs suburban voting
- More computationally intensive analysis
- Research projects requiring larger samples

---

### Level 3: Advanced Techniques

#### 6. `clear_gerrymander_example.py` - Multi-Seed Search

**What it does:**
1. Creates a **6√ó6 balanced city** (Democrats ~45-50%)
2. **Searches through 10-15 different random seeds**
3. For each seed, creates districts using `recursive_tree_part`
4. Calculates "representation gap" for each map
5. Selects the MOST FAIR and MOST BIASED maps
6. Runs MCMC on both to prove statistical difference

**Why you need it:**
- **Automated gerrymander detection** (no manual district drawing)
- Shows that algorithms can produce different fairness levels
- **Representation gap** metric for measuring bias
- Systematic search methodology

**How it works:**
```python
for seed in range(15):
    random.seed(seed)
    assignment = recursive_tree_part(...)  # Create districts

    # Calculate representation gap
    citywide_dem_pct = 45.6%
    district_dem_pct = dem_wins / 4 * 100
    gap = abs(district_dem_pct - citywide_dem_pct)

# Sort by gap
fair_map = smallest_gap      # Example: 2/4 = 50%, gap = 4.4%
biased_map = largest_gap     # Example: 3/4 = 75%, gap = 29.4%
```

**Expected results:**
- Fair map: Occurs in ~50-60% of MCMC samples ‚Üí ‚úÖ FAIR
- Biased map: Occurs in ~5-10% of MCMC samples ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è SUSPICIOUS

**How to run:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python clear_gerrymander_example.py
```

**When to use it:**
- Research projects analyzing multiple maps
- Understanding algorithmic variation
- Comparing representation gaps
- Court evidence preparation (systematic methodology)

#### 7. `extreme_gerrymandering.py` - The Most Advanced Example (FIXED!)

**What it does:**

2. Creates a **FAIR map** using simple quadrant division
3. **Searches through 50 random seeds** to find the most biased map
4. Tests BOTH maps with **2500 MCMC steps** (highest statistical power)
5. Detects suspicious gerrymandering below 10% threshold

**Why you need it:**
- **Highest detection sensitivity** (2500 MCMC steps)
- **Largest seed search** (50 trials)
- **4 districts** for better granularity
- **Strongest geographic clustering** for realistic scenarios
- **Successfully detects suspicious maps** (8.6% p-value)

**What makes it "extreme":**
1. **Enhanced Voting Pattern:**
   ```python
   if x <= 1:
       dem_votes = 80%  # LEFT: Strong Democratic
   elif x >= 4:
       dem_votes = 25%  # RIGHT: Strong Republican
   else:
       dem_votes = 55%  # CENTER: Swing
   ```

2. **Algorithmic Gerrymander Search:**
   ```python
   for seed in range(50):
       create_map(seed)
       calculate_democratic_wins()

   # Select map with FEWEST Democratic wins
   gerrymander_map = min(maps, key=lambda x: x.dem_wins)
   ```

3. **High-Power MCMC:**
   - 2500 steps per map
   - 5000 total samples generated
   - ~4 minute runtime

**Fixed Issues:**
- ‚ùå Original: Manual assignment broke contiguity
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Uses `recursive_tree_part` with 50-seed search
- ‚ùå Original: 3 districts insufficient
- ‚úÖ Fixed: 4 districts for better detection
- ‚ùå Original: Weak bias (28-32% p-value)
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Strong bias (8.6% p-value = SUSPICIOUS!)

**How to run:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python extreme_gerrymandering.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
üèÜ FINAL RESULTS
==================================================
Fair map verdict:        FAIR (57.3%)
Gerrymandered map verdict: SUSPICIOUS (8.6%)
```

**When to use it:**
- **Court-ready evidence** (high statistical power)
- **Detecting subtle gerrymandering** (below 10%)
- **Research requiring confidence** (2500 samples)
- **Demonstrating advanced techniques** (algorithmic search)
